## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
- I learned Javascript form validation using regex

```JavaScript
  const emailRegex =/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;
  const emailValid = emailInput.value.length === 0 ||emailRegex.test(emailInput.value);

```

### Continued development
- I got to explore javascript form validation and I would like to dig deep into that in a future project
### Useful resources

- MDN docs
